This is the codebase for Pyrelight, a middle-fantasy total conversion project for Space Station 13, derived from Nebula SS13.

A round of this game intends to represent a lived day (or days) in the life of someone in a remote fantasy village, whether it's a day where they struck it rich or where their house burnt down and they caught the plague.

An emphasis is placed on interconnected, generalized systems that allow for unique, emergent gameplay. Boil your tea with fire magic, forage herbs to concoct medicinal tinctures, or hunt in the woods and use your prey's bones and pelt to make your own equipment; what will *you* do?
